# Space Shooter Game 🎮

This is a basic space shooting game made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It's a browser game where you control a spaceship and shoot down enemies. I created this project as a part of my learning and to meet the challenge requirements of building a game with 3 levels and increasing difficulty.
